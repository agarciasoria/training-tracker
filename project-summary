PROJECT BRIEF: Track & Field Training Tracker
=============================================

PROJECT TYPE: Web-based personal training tracker (GitHub Pages deployment)

TARGET USERS: Track and field athletes who train in monthly cycles and want to track progress over time. Multi-user capable (shareable URL, each user uses own Google account).

CORE CONCEPT:
- Athletes train in monthly cycles where they repeat the same exercises/workouts
- Need to log multiple day entries for each workout type within a cycle
- Each day entry contains individual series/reps with specific times/weights
- Compare performance of the same workout across different days and cycles

ARCHITECTURE:

1. TWO MAIN SECTIONS:
   - Gym Sessions
   - Track Sessions

2. HIERARCHY STRUCTURE:
   Training Cycle → Workout Entries → Day Entries → Individual Series/Reps
   
   TRACK Example:
   "January 2024 Cycle" 
      → Workout Entry: "5x150m"
         → Day Entry 1 (Jan 11): 
            - Series 1: 16'57, recovery: 8'
            - Series 2: 16'08, recovery: 8'
            - Series 3: 16'81, recovery: 8'
            - Series 4: 16'93, recovery: 8'
            - Series 5: 17'02
            - Notes: "Tough session, wind against except 2nd rep"
         → Day Entry 2 (Jan 18): 
            - Series 1: 16'45, recovery: 8'
            - Series 2: 16'12, recovery: 8'
            - [only 4 reps this time]
            - Notes: "Better conditions"
      
      → Workout Entry: "3x4x100m"
         → Day Entry 1 (Jan 9):
            - Block 1: 10'96-11'05-11'06-11'7, recovery: 2' between reps, 8' after block
            - Block 2: 11'35-11'02-11'75-11'3, recovery: 2' between reps, 8' after block
            - Block 3: 11'90-11'5-11'99-11'65
            - Notes: "Windy day, tough after first block"
   
   GYM Example:
   "February 2024 Cycle"
      → Workout Entry: "Cargada (CC)"
         → Day Entry 1 (Feb 7):
            - Set 1: 6 reps @ 90kg
            - Set 2: 4 reps @ 95kg (x2 rounds)
            - Notes: "Felt strong"
         → Day Entry 2 (Feb 10):
            - Set 1: 4 reps @ 95kg
            - Set 2: 2 reps @ 100kg
            - Set 3: 4 reps @ 95kg
            - Notes: "Good progress on 100kg"

3. CYCLE MANAGEMENT:
   - Create cycles with custom names and date ranges
   - Define which workout entries (workout types) belong to each cycle
   - Rename/modify cycles → all associated data auto-updates
   - Filter/navigate by cycle

4. WORKOUT ENTRY LOGIC:
   - Each cycle contains multiple "Workout Entries" (workout formats)
   - TRACK workout formats: "5x150m", "3x4x100m", "200-200,150-150,100-100", "3x2x300m"
   - GYM workout formats: Exercise name (e.g., "Cargada", "Squats", "Bench Press")
   - Same workout entry can appear in multiple cycles for comparison

5. DAY ENTRY LOGGING:
   
   TRACK SESSIONS:
   - Select cycle → Select workout entry → Add new day entry
   - Define number of series/blocks
   - For each series: Input time and recovery time
   - Add overall notes (conditions, feelings, etc.)
   - Flexible series count (5x150m one day, 4x150m another day, same workout entry)
   
   GYM SESSIONS:
   - Select cycle → Select workout entry (exercise) → Add new day entry
   - Define sets with: reps × weight (e.g., "6x90kg")
   - Multiple sets per day entry
   - Add overall notes
   - Track progression: sets, reps, and weights over time

6. DATA STORAGE:
   - Google Sheets integration
   - Per-user authentication (Google account)
   - Each user saves to their own Google Sheet
   - Data accessible from any device
   
   SUGGESTED SHEET STRUCTURE:
   - Sheet 1: Cycles (ID, Name, Start Date, End Date)
   - Sheet 2: Workout Entries (ID, Cycle ID, Section, Workout Format/Exercise Name)
   - Sheet 3: Day Entries (ID, Workout Entry ID, Date, Notes)
   - Sheet 4: Track Series Data (Day Entry ID, Series Number, Time, Recovery)
   - Sheet 5: Gym Set Data (Day Entry ID, Set Number, Reps, Weight)

7. VISUALIZATION & COMPARISON:
   - View all day entries for a specific workout entry
   - Charts showing time improvements (track) or weight progression (gym)
   - Compare same workout across different days within a cycle
   - Compare same workout across different cycles
   - Display individual series/reps data per day
   - Average times per session, best times, progression trends
   
   Examples:
   - "5x150m progression: Jan 11 (avg 16'88) vs Jan 18 (avg 16'32) vs Feb 8 (avg 16'15)"
   - "Cargada weight progression: Feb 7 (6x90kg) → Feb 10 (2x100kg) → Feb 24 (3x2x105kg)"

8. KEY FEATURES:
   - Flexible series/rep counts per day (not rigid structure)
   - Individual time/weight tracking per series/set
   - Rich note-taking per day entry
   - Easy navigation: Cycle → Workout → All days for that workout
   - Quick comparison view of same workout across time

KEY TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Static web app compatible with GitHub Pages
- Google Sheets API integration with OAuth
- Multi-user support (shareable URL, independent user data)
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop access
- Dynamic form generation (add/remove series or sets as needed)
- Data visualization library (Chart.js or similar)

CURRENT STATUS: Planning/Design Phase
